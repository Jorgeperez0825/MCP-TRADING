# MCP Integration Issues Analysis

## Identified Problems

1. **Argument Format Mismatch**: 
   - The original implementation was trying to handle backticks in arguments (e.g., \`keywords\`: \`value\`) which is inconsistent with how MCP expects arguments.
   - MCP arguments should be properly structured JSON objects, not strings with backticks.

2. **Dual Server Architecture**:
   - Running both an HTTP server and an MCP server created complexity and potential conflicts.
   - The proxy layer added unnecessary complexity to argument parsing.

3. **URL Construction Issues**:
   - "Invalid URL" errors suggest problems with how URLs were being constructed or passed between Claude and the server.

4. **Configuration Discrepancies**:
   - The Claude configuration file may have had incorrect paths or settings.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Simplified MCP Server** (`mcp-server.js`):
   - Direct integration with the MCP protocol without proxy layers
   - Proper argument handling based on the MCP specification
   - Clear error reporting and logging for debugging

2. **Updated Claude Configuration** (`claude-config.json`):
   - Correct paths to the MCP server
   - Proper environment variable configuration
   - Single-server architecture

3. **Test Script** (`test-mcp.js`):
   - Simulates Claude's interaction with the MCP server
   - Verifies proper tool listing and calling
   - Provides clear logging for debugging

4. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`README.md`):
   - Clear setup instructions
   - Available tools documentation
   - Troubleshooting guidance

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the test script to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Place the `claude-config.json` file in Claude's configuration directory.

4. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Security Enhancements

- API key is securely passed via environment variables
- No sensitive data is exposed in logs or responses
- Input validation is performed on all requests

## Troubleshooting Steps

If Claude still reports "Invalid URL" errors:

1. Verify the Claude configuration file is correctly placed and formatted
2. Ensure the MCP server is running when Claude tries to access it
3. Check the file paths in the configuration match your system
4. Review MCP server logs (stderr) for any errors or warnings
